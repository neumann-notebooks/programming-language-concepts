    "# Lesson 3 - Programming Language Specification\n",
    "Let's use what we learned so far in order to specify a programming language of our very own: Wowza. Wowza is a simple, imperative language. In this lesson, we will specify the lexical and syntax rules of the Wowza language, but first, here's a sample program of the Wowza langauge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/*\n",
    "  My Recursive Fibonacci Program\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "func num fib(num n) {\n",
    "  if (n < 2) return 0;\n",
    "  if (n == 2) return 1;\n",
    "  return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "num n = 10;\n",
    "print(\"The first \" + n + \" numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:\");\n",
    "for i from 1 to n {\n",
    "  print(fib(i));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty neat, right? Let's get into to laying out the rules that we will use in later chapters as we build our own Wowza interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexical Rules\n",
    "Lexical rules focus on mapping lexemes with their respecitive token. We need to create rules that state: if a lexeme contains these characters, then it must be this token. A good notation to express these rules is [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "A great resource for practicing and testing regular expressions: https://regexr.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's specify the lexical rules for each operator should be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "assign_op: r\"=\"\n",
    "add_op: r\"+\"\n",
    "sub_op: r\"-\"\n",
    "mul_op: r\"*\"\n",
    "div_op: r\"/\"\n",
    "eq_op: r\"==\"\n",
    "neq_op: r\"!=\"\n",
    "lt_op: r\"<\"\n",
    "lte_op: r\"<=\"\n",
    "gt_op: r\">\"\n",
    "gte_op: r\">=\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's speicfy the rules for some of the special characters that we will encounter:\n",
    "```\n",
    "begin_block: r\"{\"\n",
    "end_block: r\"}\"\n",
    "begin_paren: r\"(\"\n",
    "end_paren: r\")\"\n",
    "comma_sep: r\",\"\n",
    "end_stmt: r\";\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's specify the rules for **kewords**. Each keword is a small string of only lowercase characters, so the corresponding regular expression is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "keyword: r\"^[a-z]+$\"\n",
    "kw_list = [\n",
    "    bool, elif, else, false, for, \n",
    "    from, func, if, num, print, \n",
    "    string, to, true, void, while\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to specify the rules for **identifiers**, which are alphanumeric characters, that must begin with a letter (underscores are also allowed):\n",
    "```\n",
    "id: r\"^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for a **string literal** are straight forward. Any character, except `\"`, can be placed between two quotation marks:\n",
    "```\n",
    "string_lit: r\"^\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\"$\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to define the **number literal**. Simply put, a number literal can be written as any of the following: `2`, `0.0`, `-23.023`, etc. It's corresponding regular expression is this: \n",
    "```\n",
    "num_lit: r\"^(-)?(([1-9][0-9]*(\\.[0-9]+)?)|(0\\.[0-9]+)|0)$\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax Rules\n",
    "Syntax rules focus on the structure and arrangement of tokens. We need to create rules that state: this component A can be evaluated as a combination of these components (B, C, and D). A good notation to express these rules is [Backus-Naur Form (BNF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form). Let's now go through the different parts of a program and how we can represent them in BNF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement List: &lt;stmt_list&gt;\n",
    "One of the most fundamental components in the Wowza language is the statement list. As you can guess, the simple Wowza language structure is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "stmt1();\n",
    "stmt2();\n",
    "stmt3();\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "A statement list is a sequence of statements, separated by a semicolon. We can represent this rule in BNF in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<stmt_list> ::= <stmt> |\n",
    "                <stmt> <end_stmt> |\n",
    "                <stmt> <end_stmt> <stmt_list>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `|` characters signify \"or\". Which is to say, a statement list could be just a `<stmt>` (one statement) or `<stmt> <end_stmt>` (one statement followed by a semi-colon). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement Block: &lt;stmt_block&gt;\n",
    "Suppose, we wright a conditional statement in Wowza:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if thisIsTrue {\n",
    "    doThis();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We need a way to express all the statements between the `{}`. We can easily do this by using the stmt list that has already been defined:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<stmt_block> ::= <begin_block> <stmt_list> <end_block>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Looking up at our lexical rules, we can see that a `begin_block` token refers to a `{`, while an `end_block` token refers to a `}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement: &lt;stmt&gt;\n",
    "Every Wowza program is a sequence of statements, similar to many other imperative languages. A statment can be either a variable declaration, assignment, conditional statement, for loop, while loop, function definition, or function call. We can easily define this in BNF as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<stmt> ::= <declare_stmt> |\n",
    "           <assign_stmt> |\n",
    "           <cond_stmt> |\n",
    "           <for_loop> |\n",
    "           <while_loop> |\n",
    "           <funcdef_stmt> |\n",
    "           <func_stmt> |\n",
    "           <ret_stmt>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration Statement: &lt;declare_stmt&gt;\n",
    "Let's look at a few variable declarations in Wowza:\n",
    "```\n",
    "num number;\n",
    "string my_name;\n",
    "bool isThisTrue;\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, there are two main components: `type` and `identifier`. A type can only be one the following keywords: `num`, `string`, `bool`, or `void`. We can express this in BNF as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<declare_stmt> ::= <type> <id>\n",
    "\n",
    "<type> ::= <num_kw> | \n",
    "           <string_kw> | \n",
    "           <bool_kw> | \n",
    "           <void_kw>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Statement: &lt;assign_stmt&gt;\n",
    "Now, let's see a couple of Wowza assignment statements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "number = 2;\n",
    "string wow = \"WOW\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice in the second statement, we are also declaring `wow`. We can express both of these ideas in BNF like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<assign_stmt> ::= <id> <assign_op> <expr> |\n",
    "                  <declare_stmt> <assign_op> <expr>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expressions: &lt;expr&gt;\n",
    "First, let's look at some expressions in Wowza:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Numerical Expressions\n",
    "a + 2\n",
    "5 - n\n",
    "4 * (n / 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "// String Expressions\n",
    "wow + \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// Boolean Expressions\n",
    "isTrue == isFalse\n",
    "n < 4\n",
    "n >= doubleNum(7)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's define the top-level `expr` token and the `term` token:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<expr> ::= <term>\n",
    "           <op_expr> |\n",
    "           <bool_expr> |\n",
    "           <begin_paren> <expr> <end_paren>\n",
    "\n",
    "<term> ::= <id> |\n",
    "           <num_lit> |\n",
    "           <string_lit> |\n",
    "           <bool_lit> |\n",
    "           <func_stmt>\n",
    "           \n",
    "<bool_lit> ::= <true_kw> |\n",
    "               <false_kw>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An `expr` can be evaluated to a `op_expr` (operator expression) or a `bool_expr` (boolean expression). So let's express all the operators (arithmetic and boolean) that can be used in each of these expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<op_expr> ::= <term> <add_op> <expr> |\n",
    "              <term> <sub_op> <expr> |\n",
    "              <term> <mul_op> <expr> |\n",
    "              <term> <div_op> <expr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<bool_expr> ::= <term> <eq_op> <expr> |\n",
    "                <term> <neq_op> <expr> |\n",
    "                <term> <lt_op> <expr> |\n",
    "                <term> <lte_op> <expr> |\n",
    "                <term> <gt_op> <expr> |\n",
    "                <term> <gte_op> <expr>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statement: &lt;cond_stmt&gt;\n",
    "As in most programming languages, Wowza expresses conditions in a `if...elif...else` manner. All of the following conditional statments are valid:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Single-line\n",
    "if d {print(\"d is true!!!\")}\n",
    "\n",
    "// No else\n",
    "if d == \"wow\" {\n",
    "    print(d);\n",
    "} elif d != \"wow\" {\n",
    "    print(\"not good\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if n < 3 {\n",
    "    print(\"n is less than\")\n",
    "} else if n > 3 {\n",
    "    print(\"n is greater than\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    print(\"n is equal\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a clever way to make sure that `elif`s and `else`s are optional, and that there can be multiple recurring `elif`s. We actually can represent this rule in BNF using three components: `cond_stmt`, `if_stmt`, and `else_stmt`. Here are the rules:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<cond_stmt> ::= <if_stmt> |\n",
    "                <if_stmt> <else_stmt>\n",
    "\n",
    "<if_stmt> ::= <if_kw> <expr> <stmt_block>\n",
    "\n",
    "<else_stmt> ::= <else_kw> <stmt_block>\n",
    "                <elif_kw> <expr> <stmt_block> |\n",
    "                <elif_kw> <expr> <stmt_block> <else_stmt>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we evalute this BNF, we can see that it does meet all of Wowza's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops: &lt;for_loop&gt; & &lt;while_loop&gt;\n",
    "Compared to the conditional statement rules, Wowza syntax rules for loops are very simple. Here are two example loops written in Wowza:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i from 1 to 3 {\n",
    "    print(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "while thisIsTrue {\n",
    "    print(\"this is still true\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding BNF notation is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<for_loop> ::= <for_kw> <id> <from_kw> <term> <to_kw> <term> <stmt_block>\n",
    "\n",
    "<while_loop> ::= <while_kw> <bool_expr> <stmt_block>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions: &lt;funcdef_stmt&gt;, &lt;func_stmt&gt;, & &lt;ret_stmt&gt; \n",
    "Finally, we have reached the last construct in the Wowza language: functions. In Wowza, we can define and call functions like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "func num foo(num n1, num n2) {\n",
    "    return n1 + n2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "num value = foo(2,2); // 2 + 2 = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key statements that we must define: `funcdef_stmt` (function definition), `func_stmt` (function call statement), and `ret_stmt` (return statment). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first work through the function definition and return statement parts. A function definition must state a return type, a function identifier, an argument list, and a statement block. Here is the BNF notation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<funcdef_stmt> ::= <func_kw> <type> <id> <begin_paren> <arg_list> <end_paren> <stmt_block>\n",
    "\n",
    "<arg_list> ::= <type> <id> |\n",
    "               <type> <id> <comma_sep> <arg_list>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ret_stmt> ::= <return_kw> <expr>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to do something very similar to the function call statement. To call the function, we must state the identifier, a pair of parenthesis, and a parameter list to pass in.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<func_stmt> ::= <id> <begin_paren> <param_list> <end_paren>\n",
    "\n",
    "<param_list> ::= <expr> |\n",
    "                 <expr> <comma_sep> <param_list>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We have now fully specified the lexical and syntax rules. In the next chapter we will look into designing and implementing a lexical analyzer and a syntax analyzer, which will get us closer to having a fully-functioning Wowza interpreter."
