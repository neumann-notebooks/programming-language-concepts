# Programming Language Concepts

> That language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted.

> George Boole (1815 - 1864)

This curriculum explore the fundamental concepts of programming languages and compiler design.

## Objectives
* Provide a foundational understanding of common constructs found in many programming languages.
* Present the notation and reasoning behind language specification.
* Explore the various approaches to designing a compiler/interpreter.
* Walk-through the development of a compiler that can translate a source language to machine code.

## Table of Contents
#### Chapter 1 - Foundations of Programming Languages
Let's explore the world of programming languages. We will look in to the different ways that languages are structured and used.
1. What are Programming Languages?
2. Functional Languages: LISP
3. Logic-based Languages: Prolog
4. Imperative Languages: Java

#### Chapter 2 - Language Design and Specification
We will look into the various design choices that can be made for a programming language. This chapter also covers how to specify and define constructs for a language. We will define our very own language: Wowza.
1. What Makes A Good Language?
2. Common Concepts in Languages
3. Programming Language Specification

#### Chapter 3 - Lexical and Syntax Analysis
We'll now learn how lexical and syntax analysis can be used to read a specified programming language. This chapter also provides examples of designing and implementing a scanner to read Wowza source files. We will also design and implement our own parser for the Wowza language.

1. Lexical Analysis
2. Syntax Analysis

#### Chapter 4 - Interpreter Design
Bringing everything we've learned together, we will work on implementing an interpretive engine to execute a generated parse tree. We will see our first Wowza program come to life.

1. Abstract Syntax Trees
2. Developing the Interpreter Engine

#### Chapter 5 - Compiler Development
Using the code and concepts learned so far, we will develop our own compiler that can generate an executable file from a Wowza source file.

1. Machine Code Generation
2. Compiler Development
